        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>A food diary is a record of foods that you eat on a meal-by-meal, daily, or weekly basis. You can include nutritional or other dietary information, organize and track foods by food group, and so on. This lets you monitor what, when, and how often you eat, as well as where your nutrition needs lie.</p>

        <h4>Our Chief</h4>
        <p>With how fast-paced the world has become, it's sometimes easy to fall into the trap of eating too much or too often if you're constantly on the go. Taking the time to consciously track what you're eating in a diary can help you be more mindful of what, how much, and how often you eat</p>

        <p>Eating right is a key part of staying healthy, but it's not the only thing that you need to think about. Exercise, sleep, your mental state, and even sex, help to make up the bigger picture of your overall health. Tracking your eating habits alongside your other daily habits can help you put a regular routine together and plan out your day better. </p>
